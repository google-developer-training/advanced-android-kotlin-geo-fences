/**
 * The Treasure Hunt app is a single-player game based on geofences.
 *
 * This app demonstrates how to create and remove geofences using the GeofencingApi. Uses an
 * BroadcastReceiver to monitor geofence transitions and creates notification and finishes the game
 * when the user enters the final geofence (destination).
 *
 * This app requires a device's Location settings to be turned on. It also requires
 * the ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION permission and user consent. For geofences to work
 * in Android Q, app also needs the ACCESS_BACKGROUND_LOCATION permission and user consent.
