/*
 * Triggered by the Geofence.  Since we only have one active Geofence at once, we pull the request
 * ID from the first Geofence, and locate it within the registered landmark data in our
 * GeofencingConstants within GeofenceUtils, which is a linear string search. If we had  very large
 * numbers of Geofence possibilities, it might make sense to use a different data structure.  We
 * then pass the Geofence index into the notification, which allows us to have a custom "found"
 * message associated with each Geofence.
